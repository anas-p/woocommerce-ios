E-mailing a note to a customer for an order with no e-mail address doesn’t make much sense – so we’re hiding that option now in that case.

Some merchants mentioned to us that orders with negative prices weren’t showing up correctly. We’ve fixed that issue, and now you should feel more positive!

This release also contains a bunch of tiny improvements to make your experience smoother overall. We hope you notice the love we put into our software.
